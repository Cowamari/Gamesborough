    <h1>About This Site</h1>
	<p>This site was created in October of 2023 for a school project. It is meant to catalog some of my lengthier 
       thoughts about certain pieces of media. Currently there are three reviews posted. There is also a form where you can
	   leave feedback for specific reviews or the website as a whole. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me. 
	   My email is at the bottom of the page.</p>
