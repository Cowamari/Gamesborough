    <h1>Songs About Leaving by Carissa's Wierd</h1>
	<p>Record labels are tasked with the messy business side of the music industry. Whether or not artists avoid the distribution and promotional processes, these aspects are usually 
	overlooked when discussing the core of an album. However, sometimes an experience with a piece of media is inevitably altered through either marketing or word of mouth. This 
    phenomenon is further amplified when the art is associated with a big corporate brand. Sub Pop, the primary subject of this review, prides itself on presenting itself with a 
	specific image. The slogan on their website, &ldquo;We're not the best, but we're pretty good&rdquo; is designed to give their target demographic the idea that they have a
	personality. Of course, it's just a faceless corporation. But by putting in the effort for marketing the marketing company, their associated musical acts also gain credibility. Like 
	it's a high honor to be accepted on the label.</p>
	<p>Sub Pop is associated with many well-regarded bands from the last thirty years. The old Seattle grunge classics are obviously exempt from being mentally associated alongside their
	corporate overlords. But the indie artists they've signed like &ldquo;Low,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Postal Service&rdquo; have sort of a strange relation from my perspective. They and
    their contemporaries have a few commonalities that make it seem like there's a cohesive bond between their sounds despite coming from different eras. When I first listened to &ldquo;Songs 
    About Leaving&rdquo; a few months ago, I got the same sort of vibes. I do feel the need to bring up the fact that I did do a little bit of surface level research before sitting down
    for the forty minute run time. Doing so likely inspired this discussion of Sub Pop and the role of record labels as a whole alongside expectations. Given the actual content and emotions
    expressed by the album and my personal tastes, it makes sense that I would be more drawn towards discussing it from a mysticism angle.</p>
	<p> If you've heard anything about this album, it probably relates to its somber lyrics. With such great track titles like &ldquo;You Should be Hated Here&rdquo; and 
	&ldquo;They'll Only Miss You When You Leave,&rdquo; it's clear that this album's optimal listening conditions are at a coked out frat party. Jokes aside, I understand it's ultimately a very vapid
	statement regarding the album and that I'm sort of helping to perpetuate it by even bringing it forth. Unfortunately, the label is quite firmly attached to the record for better or worse.
	In giving my two cents and sort of going back to the Sub Pop thing, I don't think I've listened to another record that mixes guitar and violin as well as Songs About Leaving does. It definitely
	enhances the expressiveness delivered by the band. A lesser project aiming for a similar feel to this would likely go for some 80BPM minimalist avant-garde rubbish. Whether it's the band or
	producer responsible for this synergy, Sub Pop at least recognizes the best kind of depression-fueled music and has carved out a musical space that encapsulates this niche genre.
	Even with Time Warner's name somewhere in the giant nested list of credits and my choice to deliberately not delve into the thematic motifs of the album, &ldquo;Songs About Leaving&rdquo; still gives me 
	pretty much exactly what I want out of a pathos driven record. If you are interested in learning about the band's background, there's not exactly a ton of information, but 
	<a href="https://www.68to05.com/essays/1999-carissas-wierd">SixtyEight2OHFive</a> would probably be a good place to start.</p>
