	<h2><a href="movie.html">Angel Dust</a></h2> 
	<p>Horror generally is not my cup of tea and &ldquo;Angel Dust&rdquo; does not really change that fact. But given its method of scaring the audience, I can
	appreciate a few things about it despite not finding the film compelling as a whole. Date of Review: November 10th, 2023.</p>
    <h2><a href="album2.html">Songs About Leaving</a></h2> 
	<p>Some avid observers may have noticed that I generally only provide the name of the artist or studio when its either 
    absolutely necessary for proving a point or at the beginning of the review. The latter being done only to distinguish properties with the same name.
    Most works are quite collaborative by nature, so it doesn't really feel right to me to only include one or two names/company. Obviously, if I ever do 
	something by a single auteur or a self published book, I will try to be more inclusive in that regard. Nonetheless, for this review, I'll focus on a single
    big name of the music industry. It might not be the one that you expect. Date of Review: November 7th, 2023.</p>
    <h2><a href="album1.html">Nowhere</a></h2> 
	<p>Often times, when an album has an overwhelming presence on its year of release, it has a big single to back it up. Like a &ldquo;Teen Spirit&rdquo;
	for Nirvana or a &ldquo;Get Lucky&rdquo; kinda deal. A so called sound of the summer. Even when dealing with the 90s Oxford music scene and despite its posh 
	stereotype, the same remains true. However, I often find the fact that these singles misrepresent the album disappointing. &ldquo;Nowhere&rdquo; is no exception 
	to these feelings. Date of Review: November 1st, 2023.</p>
