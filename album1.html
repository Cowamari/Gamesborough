    <h1>Nowhere by Ride</h1>
	<p>Before releasing their big debut, Ride released a handful of EPs that hinted at what would come. While it was not really a sneak peek of the album as a whole,
	it did reveal a lot of their influences and the genre's as well. Between the power-pop, folk, and post-punk; they've got more range
	than the other big two of shoegaze. In general, I've found that they go for flashier melodies than &ldquo;Slowdive,&rdquo; but less psychedelic instrumentation when 
	compared to MBV. However, the first 3EPs really lack an identity of their own and if they ended up being Ride's critical darlings, then I'm not sure they 
	would have become as big as they did. The only thing that brings a doubt to that idea is Nowhere's first single, &ldquo;Vapour Trail.&rdquo;</p>
	<p>Back in the late 2000s, I remember checking out the cover of every single record that I could slip out of the shelf in a store in Atlanta. While I didn't 
	enjoy music back then with the same passion I do now, I still wanted to listen to all the albums with eye-catching covers. As such, it's easy to
	imagine a high school or college student in 90 doing much the same when they come across an unsuspecting photograph of a wave. When
	an album cover brings forth a calm minimalism, it indicates that there is a trust that the listener will either have the patience or interest for it. Granted, a 
	lot of albums nowadays made by hack-frauds still have pretty neat cover art. And even then, I'm not entirely sure what I originally thought when I saw it for
	the first time given the fact that it's been 7ish years. Nonetheless, looking at it now, I do get those sorts of vibes from it. If I really want to recount 
	my initial thoughts of &ldquo;Nowhere,&rdquo; however, they can be found in its amazing first half.</p>
	<p>The opening track &ldquo;Seagull&rdquo; has that 80s power pop sound. What that ultimately meant to me at the time was that I could enjoy the song even when
	the band busted out harsh sonic landscapes. Those brief moments of jangly reprise undoubtedly helped shape my music taste towards more of the esoteric. 
	&ldquo;In a Different Place&rdquo; also helped by presenting itself as a ballady type thing, only using loud guitars toward the end of the track. &ldquo;Dreams Burn Down&rdquo; 
	on the other hand didn't really pretend to be anything other than a shoegaze track. It may be one of my favorites now, but back then I did not have the palette for it. 
	That's sort of strange thinking about it now considering that the following track, &ldquo;Decay&rdquo;, has an equally screeching choice of instrumentation, but still ended up
	one of my favorites at the end of my first listen. The simple bass line throughout the song probably has something to do with it. Also, Taste's high rating likely supports this
	idea. &ldquo;Paralyzed&rdquo; breaks the trend of the last couple of songs by falling somewhere in the middle of the cyclical high and low intensity. It mixes some folk with 
	Madchester psychedelia and balances the line between structured and loose. Overall, even with my dislike of some of the album's choices caused by my immature musical range, I 
	still respected the sound diversity present on &ldquo;Nowhere.&rdquo; That is until I got a little over halfway through the album.</p>
	<p> As soon as &ldquo;Vapour Trail.&rdquo; hit my speakers for the first time, I didn't really feel one way or the other about it. Considering the impact that the other songs 
    left on me, I do consider it a black spot on an otherwise great first listening experience. However, the more I listened to &ldquo;Nowhere&rdquo; over the last few years, the more difficult
	it became to resist skipping it. And so, I usually only listen to the other 14 tracks, even if a lot of it afterwards doesn't hit as hard as the first half. The two exceptions
	to this rule, &ldquo;Taste&rdquo; and &ldquo;Here and Now&rdquo; both have a few exceptional qualities to them. &ldquo;Here and Now&rdquo; especially given the fact that it 
    makes the harmonica sound cool. Understandably, track orderings are difficult to get right. Especially since creating 14 bangers is rare on its own. Nonetheless, 
	Vapour Trail's status as Ride's signature song is still a bit baffling for me.</p>
	<p>It's not entirely uncommon for a band's most well known song to be their simplest. But &ldquo;Vapour Trail.&rdquo; is unique in that its simplicity comes from the 
	song's mechanics rather than its intention, structure, or instrumentation. Guitar pedals are a big part of the shoegaze genre and as far as I can tell, each strum on the song 
	is done completely unfiltered from the amp. Yet the song itself does not indicate that it's meant to be a raw experience. Rather it sort of goes for a jangle-pop type thing,
	but seemingly without the cleanest jangle nor the catchiest hook. Because I've already listened to the album around a dozen times, there are not a lot of the things left for me to
	discover about it. Therefore, whenever I take &ldquo;Nowhere&rdquo; for a spin, one of the only things that I can &ldquo;discover&rdquo; is something to appreciate about &ldquo;Vapour Trail.&rdquo;.
	So even though this is probably one of my favorite albums of all time, I guess the negatives of it are more interesting to talk about for me. Furthermore, while I'm in the minority of 
	the overall Ride fanbase, I've also never been in the proper time or location to feel the music in its original state. Ultimately, maybe I'll never be able to understand the appeal of 
	&ldquo;Vapour Trail.&rdquo; due to being &ldquo;In a Different Place&rdquo; from where &ldquo;Nowhere&rdquo; initially took off.</p>
