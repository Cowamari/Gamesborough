    <h1>Angel Dust Directed by Gakury√ª Ishii</h1>
	<p>I'm not gonna lie, the only reason I watched &ldquo;Angel Dust&rdquo; the whole way through was because I heard rumors that it was a big inspiration for one of my favorite creators, Goichi 
	Suda. Actually analyzing the themes, content, and other artistic choices, I think that the gossip was a little exaggerated, with maybe only some visual motifs supporting those individuals'
    beliefs. So honestly, at the end of the nearly two hour run time, I wasn't really satisfied or even happy that I watched the movie. I thought that the slow paced dialogue was boring
    and ineffective at building tension, that the crime the movie builds itself off of is sort of overly dubious even after everything is revealed, and most importantly, that it was too
    far rooted in reality for me to ignore its storytelling staticness. I also watched it with my dad, which made these things stick out more when he inevitably gave me several befuddled glances
    by the end of it. However, after sitting on it for a good couple of weeks, there is one aspect that has had an emotional impact on me that I did not give the movie credit for initially.</p>
	<p> I'm going to try to explain this while avoiding spoilers. My reasoning being that the one thing keeping me from turning the movie off at the 75 percent mark was the belief that the plot
    might become &ldquo;good.&rdquo; Furthermore, if a reader briefly researched &ldquo;Angel Dust,&rdquo; figured out it was their kind of movie, but still wanted to see this review; then I wouldn't want to ruin
 	 it for them. I'm aware that it's one of the appeals of these foreign atmospheric films. That being said, the first thing I wanna discuss is the movie's ending. While it was clear from the mystery's
    unconventional nature as well as its presentation that the ending would not follow traditional tropes from the genre, I do not think that it earned the subversion the ending settles on. A cultural 
	barrier may be responsible for this next issue, but it was very difficult for me to sympathize with the main actress. So when the ending screws her over and avoids resolving the main conflicts of the film,
    I was left with that previously mentioned regret. I suppose then that the visionaries were going for a horror tone the entire time and that the mystery elements were meant to be ignored.</p>
	<p>Bad endings are a pretty common trope from that genre, so it shouldn't really leave me disappointed right? Well... not quite. Like I said, I didn't think that the ending was earned and just writing
    it off as a byproduct of horror is a tad disingenuous. If you actually watch the movie, there's really only one scene close to the beginning and a couple towards the end that earn the film the label 
    of &ldquo;horror.&rdquo; I mentioned earlier that the creative intention of the film was for the mystery elements to simply be set dressing. However, that's sort of just an assumption based on the mindset 
	that I needed to be in to get anything out of the film. The noir aspects very well could have been intended as the most important part of the film. Differently colored moons have their own static shots
    sprinkled throughout the runtime, which are obviously meant to symbolize something. Given the context provided by exposition as well as certain other pieces of less subtle Japanese media, I do kinda lean towards
	these images having a misogynistic connotation. Ultimately though, I don't really wanna assume bad faith without having access to any translated supplemental material. The only reason that I mentioned this
    in the first place is because some of the film's other eccentricities still kinda bewilder me. Just keep in mind that it's very difficult to justify some of its presentation choices with my interpretation.</p>
	<p>The more subtle sort of tensionless horror comes from the fact that the main character is slowly losing her mind. Just focusing on that part, it's not only easier for me to relate to her on a personal level, 
	but also makes the movie scarier in retrospect. I think that the meaning of psychological horror has never really been clear to me until now. Control is an extremely valuable thing in my eyes and having it
    ripped away by something else not just for selfish reasons, but seemingly for curiosity's sake is significantly more terrifying than a jumpscare monster or even something less literal like growing old. That 
	ambiguity regarding the villain's motivation also enhances the terror. As I've been typing out this review for the past couple of hours, I've ended up changing a lot more of the argument structures and points 
	when compared to the other two articles. So coming at the end of this review, I'm a little lost on what the main take home point should be; if only because of how different this turned out from what I had 
    planned. Actually re-reading this again, I think it sort of naturally transitions into something about exploring new media even if you're pretty sure you won't like it. Uhhhh, but I'm not really sure that
    lines up with my own beliefs LOL. If you watched &ldquo;Angel Dust&rdquo; and disagree with my main takeaways and critiques, you can fill out the newly implemented feedback page to give your personal thoughts.</p>
